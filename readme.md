# TicTacToe Ai in the Go Programming Language

I wanted to learn Go, so I created a TicTacToe Ai using the minimax algorithm. First I created a normal PvP version and then tried to add the minimax algorithm. I forgot to change the scoreGame method and accedentially created an ai, that doesn't let you loose. And since it was to easy to get a draw every time, because I am such a tictactoe master, I tried removing the printBoard method to make it a bit harder. After that I tried creating an Api for it.
